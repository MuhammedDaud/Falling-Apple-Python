# 🍎 Falling Apples with Water Ripple Effect

This project is a simple interactive web page featuring **falling apples** and a **water ripple effect**. Apples fall continuously from the top, and when clicked, they disappear, triggering a smooth ripple effect. 

## 🎯 Features
- **Continuous Falling Apples:** Apples fall independently with varying speeds and intervals.
- **Interactive Clicks:** Clicking on an apple makes it disappear.
- **Ripple Effect:** A water ripple effect appears at the click position.
- **Beautiful Tree Background:** The page features a scenic forest-themed background.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML** – Structure of the page.
- **CSS** – Styling the page, animations, and ripple effect.
- **JavaScript** – Adding interactive behavior and dynamic animations.
